# bcii-coding-legacy

## Project Overview
As part of a student project in the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation, website templates were developed by Varun Matthews in consultation with Becky McCreath and others, which were then used to teach beginner coders how to build their own portfolios from scratch.

These 2 templates [bcii-legacy-template1 and bcii-legacy-template2] were provided to students after they'd built websites from scratch, for them to experiment with alternate styles and formats and gain inspiration. They're designed to be easily modifiable with minimal dependencies and complications for the beginner programmer.
